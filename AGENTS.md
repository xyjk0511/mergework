# MergeWork Agent Instructions

## Project Purpose

MergeWork rewards accepted open-source work. Humans and AI agents earn MRWK only
when project maintainers accept useful issues, pull requests, docs, tests, or
verified reports.

## Bounty Lifecycle

Before treating work as payable, read
[docs/bounty-lifecycle.md](docs/bounty-lifecycle.md). Proposed-work and pending
create_bounty issues are not claimable. A bounty is claimable only after
`mrwk:bounty`, `Reserved on MergeWork`, and the public bounty row exist. Pending
pay_bounty proposals are not paid until a proof exists.

## Public Artifact Hygiene

- Do not make investment claims, price claims, or fabricated payout claims.
- Do not publish private vulnerability details or unreleased exploit steps.
- Say MRWK starts as a native project coin and may support future snapshots,
  bridges, and onchain claims.
- Keep public prose short, direct, and human.

## Setup

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
./.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Checks

Run these before opening a PR:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m pytest
./.venv/bin/python -m ruff format --check .
./.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
./.venv/bin/python -m mypy app
```

## Architecture Map

- `app/models.py`, `app/db.py`, `app/config.py`: SQLAlchemy models, database
  connection, and application configuration.
- `app/ledger/`: fixed-supply MRWK ledger, proof logic, and payout reconciliation.
- `app/wallets.py`: MRWK wallet address, canonical payload, and Ed25519 signature
  helpers.
- `app/webhooks/`: GitHub webhook signature verification and idempotent
  label-to-payout processing.
- `app/auth.py`, `app/me.py`: GitHub OAuth sign-in, session handling, and
  authenticated user profile.
- `app/bounty_api.py`, `app/bounty_attempts.py`, `app/activity.py`: bounty CRUD,
  advisory attempt reservations, and proof-backed accepted-work summaries.
- `app/admin.py`, `app/admin_routes.py`: admin-token gated endpoints for bounty
  posting, acceptance, payment, and webhook-event inspection.
- `app/mcp.py`, `app/mcp_tools.py`: Model Context Protocol server and tool
  implementations (`list_bounties`, `get_bounty`, `get_balance`, etc.).
- `app/main.py`: FastAPI application, route registration, and lifespan.
- `app/public_routes.py`, `app/hub.py`: public HTML pages and hub dashboard.
- `app/templates/`, `app/static/`: Jinja2 HTML templates, CSS, and client-side JS.
- `migrations/`, `alembic.ini`: database schema migrations.
- `scripts/`: quality gates, smoke checks, payout reconciliation, and deploy
  readiness checks.
- `tests/`: behavior tests for ledger, webhooks, API, MCP, and wallets.
- `docs/`: contributor-facing and operator-facing documentation.

## Contribution Rules

- Keep PRs focused and small.
- Add or update tests for changed behavior.
- Update docs when public behavior changes.
- Ledger changes require supply conservation and hash-chain tests.
- Wallet changes require signature, nonce, replay, and spend tests.
- Webhook changes require signature verification and replay tests.

## Security Reports

Private findings stay private until maintainers approve disclosure. Public
ledger entries for security work must use redacted proof metadata only.
